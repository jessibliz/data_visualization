# ProsperLoan Exploration 
## by Mgbekwute Jecinta Obianuju


## Dataset

There are 113937 loans in the Dataset with 81 features. 59 columns of the variables are numeric in nature while 22 are categorical variables. The Investigation was carried out exploring various features of the dataset that could have an effect on OnTimeProsperPayments, or between each other. 
Various features such as  Term(the length of the Loan express in month), BorrowerAPR(The borrower's Annual Percentage Rate for the Loan),OnTimeProsperPayment, ProsperRating(Alpha), StatedMonthlyIncome, 
BorrowerRate and LoanOriginalAmount were explored to find out for any relationships.


## Summary of Findings in the Exploration, I found out that there is a strong relationship between MonthlyLoanPayment and OnTimeProsperPayments with greater OnTimeProsperPayments having a better ProsperScore. 
This distribution showed a linear relationship between these two features.
There is also a positive correlation between MonthlyLoanPayment and LoanOriginalAmount. This showed a linear relationship between the two variable.


## Key Insights for Presentation 

A pointplot of IncomeRange and OnTimeProsperPayments over Term(months) showed at around $0 indicate the highest count of OnTimeProsperPayments over 60 days Term and this flatten out across all Term even as IncomeRange increases. I realised that MonthlyLoanPayment plays a major role in OnTimeProsperPayments and LoanOriginalAmount.
